<h1>About Me</h1>
 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/3eJL1b3.jpg">
<h2>Education</h2>
<hr>
<p> I am a rising third year the University of Virginia originally from Newtown, Pennsylvania. I have just enrolled into the McIntire School of Commerce, where I plan on concentrating in Finance in IT, because I want to explore a career in finance or technology.
<h2>Interests</h2>
<hr>
<p> At school, I participate in a lot of event planning through the University Programs Council, which plans events for small and large school university events, mainly recreational. I was a part of the short courses committee, the late night committee, and this year plan to transition to the marketing committee. I am a social chair for the Third Year Council, which plans social events for the rising third year class. I also serve as the business programming coordinator for the student run incubator, Hackcville.</p>
<h2>Random</h2>
<hr>
<p> I really enjoy spending time with friends. In my free time, I binge watch netflix and enjoy making crafts such as homemade cards. I used to dance (ballet, jazz, tap) and in college joined the bhangra team. I am extremely terrible on two wheeled vehicles. The only bone I've broken was in my finger when I fell off a razor scooter at the age of 6. When I was 14, I gained many scars from learning to ride a bike, at which I'm still awful. At age 17, I went to Germany, where I crashed a moped.
